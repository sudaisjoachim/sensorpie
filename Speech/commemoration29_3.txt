Dear fellow Rwandans,

Today, we come together to remember and honor the lives lost during the 1994 Genocide Against the Tutsi. 
It is a day of remembrance, a day to pay tribute to the victims, and a day to reaffirm our commitment to 
building a better future for Rwanda.

For 29 years, we have come together to remember those who were killed, to support the survivors, and to 
work towards healing and reconciliation. And while the memories of the genocide are still painful, 
we must never forget the lessons that we have learned.

The genocide was a dark moment in our history, but we have made tremendous progress in the years since. 
We have worked hard to promote unity, peace, and reconciliation, and to build a society that is based 
on shared values of respect, dignity, and human rights.

But there is still much work to be done. We must continue to work towards the healing and reconciliation 
of our society, to promote social justice, and to ensure that the rights and needs of all Rwandans are met.

As we remember those who were killed, we also pay tribute to the bravery and resilience of the survivors. 
They have shown us that even in the darkest of times, hope and strength can prevail. They have taught us 
that it is possible to heal from even the most unimaginable of traumas.

We also honor the memory of those who have dedicated their lives to promoting peace, healing, and reconciliation. 
We pay tribute to the courageous men and women who have worked tirelessly to ensure that justice is served, 
that survivors are cared for, and that the memory of those who were lost is never forgotten.

As we gather here today to remember those who were killed, let us also look to the future with hope and optimism. 
Let us work together to build a society that is based on mutual respect, understanding, and compassion. 
Let us continue to strive for a future where all Rwandans can live in peace, prosperity, and dignity.

Thank you.
