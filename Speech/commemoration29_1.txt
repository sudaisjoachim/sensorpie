Dear fellow Rwandans and esteemed guests,


Today, we gather to remember the tragic events that took place 29 years ago during the 1994 Genocide Against the Tutsi. 
It is a solemn(Solam) occasion that reminds us of the immense pain and suffering endured by so many of our fellow 
Rwandans.

We come together to honor the memory of those who lost their lives during those dark days, to acknowledge the resilience 
and strength of the survivors, and to reaffirm(riyafam) our commitment to building a better future for Rwanda.

As we reflect on the past, we must also look to the future. Rwanda has shown remarkable resilience, and
progress, the country is now a model of peace, stability, and development, with a rapidly growing economy, 
a vibrant culture, and a welcoming people.

We have worked hard to promote unity and reconciliation, to create a society that is inclusive and respectful of all 
its citizens, and to provide opportunities for everyone to achieve their full potential.

On this occasion, I want to pay tribute to the resilience and courage of the Rwandan people. Despite the unimaginable 
horrors that were inflicted upon us, we have emerged stronger and more determined than ever before. We are a nation that 
has faced hardship with unwavering resolve, and we will continue to do so in the years ahead.

Finally, I want to express my gratitude to all those who have supported us in our journey of healing and reconciliation. 

Rwandan government , our embassy in Japan, our international partners, to the diaspora, and to all those who 
have stood with us, we say thank you. Your support and solidarity have been instrumental in helping us to build a better 
future for Rwanda.

Let us remain committed to building a society that is based on mutual respect, understanding, and compassion.
Let us continue to work together to ensure that Rwanda remains a shining example of hope, peace, and progress 
for generations to come.


Thank you , God bless you
