Ladies and gentlemen,

Today, we gather to commemorate the 29th anniversary of the 1994 Genocide Against the Tutsi. 
It is a day of reflection, of remembrance, and of renewal.

As we remember the lives lost, we also honor the survivors, who have shown incredible strength 
and resilience in the face of unimaginable horror. We also pay tribute to the bravery of those 
who risked their own lives to save others during the genocide.

We gather here today to pay our respects to the victims, to stand in solidarity with the survivors, 
and to reaffirm our commitment to preventing such atrocities from ever happening again.

The genocide was a dark moment in our history, but we have come a long way since then. Rwanda has 
made great strides in building a society that is based on unity, reconciliation, and respect for 
human rights. We have worked hard to promote social justice and to create opportunities for all 
Rwandans to achieve their full potential.

But there is still much work to be done. We must continue to confront the legacy of the genocide, 
to address the root causes of conflict, and to promote sustainable development that benefits all members of society.

On this day of remembrance, we also honor the memory of those who have dedicated their lives to 
promoting peace, healing, and reconciliation. We pay tribute to the courageous men and women who 
have worked tirelessly to ensure that justice is served, that survivors are cared for, and that 
the memory of those who were lost is never forgotten.

As we commemorate the 29th anniversary of the genocide, let us remember that we have the power 
to shape our future. Let us remain committed to building a society that is based on mutual respect, 
understanding, and compassion. Let us continue to work together to ensure that Rwanda remains a shining 
example of hope, peace, and progress for generations to come.

Thank you.
